# Remove-Extension

KDE Dolphin Service Menu, that removes the extension from one or more filenames and renames the files accordingly.

## Dependency

bash

## Notes

Remove-Extension is as cautiously as it can be. It will *not* create nodes with an empty name and it will not overwrite existing nodes.

Inside the .desktop file there is a second Action, that will be interactive and will ask before renaming. You have to edit the file manually to use it.
