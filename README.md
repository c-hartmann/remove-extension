# Remove-Extension

KDE Dolphin Servie Menu, that removes the extension from one or more filenames and renames the files accordingly. Takes no action on filenames starting with a dot.

## Dependency

bash

## Notes

Remove-Extension is a cautiously as it can be. It will *not* create nodes with an empty name and it will not overwrite existing nodes.

Inside the .desktop file there is a second Action, that will be interactive and will ask before renaming. You have to edit the file manualy to use it.
